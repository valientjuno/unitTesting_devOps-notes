just some notes on unit testing/dev ops

### test driven development

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you first write an automated unit test that fails, then write the minimum amount of production code needed to make the test pass. After that, you refactor the code (and tests if needed) while ensuring all tests continue to pass. This cycle is repeated for each new piece of functionality.

### The classic TDD cycle (Red → Green → Refactor):

Red – Write a test for a new feature. It fails (because the code doesn’t exist yet).

Green – Write just enough code to make the test pass.

Refactor – Clean up and improve the code without changing behavior, keeping all tests passing.

### Why this matters

Forces you to think about requirements first

Encourages small, focused functions

Catches bugs early

Makes refactoring way safer

Builds confidence in your codebase
